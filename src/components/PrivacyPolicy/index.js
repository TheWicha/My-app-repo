                We care about protecting the privacy of children. We won’t knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally
                identifying information. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves
                (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. If you’re under 13, please 
                do not provide us with any personally identifying information (such as your name, your email address or your phone number).
